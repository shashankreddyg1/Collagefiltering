# College Filtering Application

A full-stack, production-ready web application that helps students explore, filter, and compare colleges based on key criteria like location, branch, fees, and rankings. Built with a modern React frontend and a Python backend, this tool simplifies the decision-making process for higher education.

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying or using the application, verify the following functionality:

1. Start the backend server and confirm it's running properly
2. Launch the frontend React application and ensure it loads correctly
3. Test all search filters individually and in combination
4. Verify the college comparison feature works with multiple selections
5. Add colleges to favorites and confirm they persist after page refresh
6. Test the CSV export functionality with different result sets

## Technology Stack

The platform is built using modern technologies chosen for performance, scalability, and maintainability:

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | React.js with Material UI for component library |
| Backend | Python with FastAPI or Flask for API development |
| Database | MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage |
| Styling | CSS combined with Material UI theming |
| Development | Git for version control, Docker for containerization |
| Deployment | Netlify or Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend |

## Future Enhancements

Several improvements and features are planned for future releases:

- Enhanced college data including ratings, tuition details, and enrollment statistics
- Advanced theme customization options in the App.css configuration
- Cloud deployment setup for both backend (Render/Heroku) and frontend (Netlify/Vercel)
- User authentication system for personalized favorites and preferences
- Advanced search algorithms with machine learning recommendations
- Integration with external college databases and APIs
- Mobile application development for iOS and Android platforms
